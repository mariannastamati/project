Construction of a graph index with two modes Filtered Vamana and Stitched Vamana, implementation of FilteredGreedySearch and FilteredRobustPrune algorithms, 
finding start node (medoid for each filter) using FindMedoid algorithm.  
Datasets have only one filter on each element/node (Datasets, before being used, are "cleaned" from timestamps. Also queries involving timestamps are removed). 

A ```groundtruth.h``` file has also been implemented that contains the function for generating a groundtruth.txt file (using  brute force) containing the 100 real nearest neighbors for each query point. (groundtruth.txt file is used to check and find the recall)

Also, there is a timer to count the total execution time of the program and two separate timers to count for the creation of Filtered Vamana graph and Stitched Vamana graph as well.

### Part 3 - Optimizations

A program that runs in separate phases.

#### Main Program

To compile: ```make```  

To run Groundtruth phase using default arguments: ```make run-groundtruth```  
To run Filtered Vamana phase using default arguments: ```make run-filtered```   
To run Stitched Vamana phase using default arguments: ```make run-stitched```   
To run Greedy for queries phase using default arguments: ```make run-greedy```  
To run all phases using default arguments: ```make run-all```   

To run Greedy for queries phase and save recall: ```make save-greedy```   

To run Groundtruth phase under Valgrind: ```make val-groundtruth```  
To run Filtered Vamana phase under Valgrind: ```make val-filtered```   
To run Stitched Vamana phase under Valgrind: ```make val-stitched```   
To run Greedy for queries phase under Valgrind: ```make val-greedy```  
To run all phases under Valgrind: ```make val-all```   

#### Test Main Program

To run with Test Main: ```make run-test```  
To run with Test Main under Valgrind:  ```make val-test``` 

To clean all: ```make clean``` (cleans all - including main.o and test.o)

* For **custom arguments** use the same commands as above, just add the new value to the argument you want to change.    
e.g. ```make run-filtered t=20 a=1.1```   
This command runs Filtered Vamana phase and changes only the value of **a** and **t** with the custom values. (the order of custom arguments does not matter)
